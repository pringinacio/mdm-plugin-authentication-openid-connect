## Requirements

* Java 12 (AdoptOpenJDK)
* Grails 4.0.3+
* Gradle 6.5+

All of the above can be installed and easily maintained by using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/install).

## Applying the Plugin

The preferred way of running Mauro Data Mapper is using the [mdm-docker](https://github.com/MauroDataMapper/mdm-docker) deployment. However you can
also run the backend on its own from [mdm-application-build](https://github.com/MauroDataMapper/mdm-application-build).

### mdm-docker

In the `docker-compose.yml` file add:

```yml
mauro-data-mapper:
    build:
        args:
            ADDITIONAL_PLUGINS: "uk.ac.ox.softeng.maurodatamapper.plugins:mdm-plugin-authentication-openid-connect:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

Please note, if adding more than one plugin, this is a semicolon-separated list

### mdm-application-build

In the `build.gradle` file add:

```groovy
grails {
    plugins {
        runtimeOnly 'uk.ac.ox.softeng.maurodatamapper.plugins:mdm-plugin-authentication-openid-connect:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
    }
}
```

## Workflow

### Authentication Workflow
Described by https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow

1. UI requests known providers from us
2. User clicks link provided by UI
   * UI has to add the `redirect_uri` url param to the url
3. User is taken to authentication request url
4. User authenticates
5. Auth returns response with params in url
    * session_state 
    * code 
    * state 
6. UI sends these params to API as the body of a login request
    * session_state
    * code
    * state
    * redirect_uri = exact uri used by UI
    * nonce (sent from API but dynamically created each time so API doesnt know what it is)
7. API calls the access token endpoint using these parameters as a urlencoded form post 
   (also use basic auth header with username: `client_secret`,password: `$clientSecret`)
    * client_id
    * client_secret
    * grant_type
    * code
    * redirect_uri
    * session_state
8. Response back in JSON form
    * access_token
    * expires_in
    * refresh_expires_in
    * token_type
    * id_token
    * not-before-policy
    * session_state
    * scope
9. API verifies the id_token which is a JWT
10. API retrieves userinfo to create user if one does not exist, otherwise grabs user for the email
11. API stores the token data into the database?
    

## Access Workflow

1. Every subsequent API call is interecepted and the token is checked to ensure the access_token is still valid
   * Done by checking "now" vs decodedjwt "getExpiresAt"
   * access tokens are not always JWT, they are provider specific, so we treat them as coded strings as we dont want to rely on functionality which may not be there  
2. If expired then we check for a refresh token and if that has expired
3. If refresh token and not expired then we call for a new access token and update whats stored
4. If no refresh token or expired then we invalidate the session and return


Notes:

The API supplies all of the authentication url prebuilt and requires the UI to add the `redirect_uri` parameter

## Openid Connect Specifications

### Authorisation Endpoint

https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint

### Access Token Endpoint

https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenEndpoint

A failed attempt will nullify the code returned by the UI, requiring a request for a new code

### User Information Endpoint

https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo

### Client Authentication

## Provider Specific Documentation

### Keycloak Documentation

### Google Documentation

https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect

Note that refresh token is not sent as the access token has a 51min expiry life and therefore is unlikely to be needed.
I believe that making any access check request "resets" the expiry counter but this will need to be checked
It may also be the same for Keycloak with the "reset"
